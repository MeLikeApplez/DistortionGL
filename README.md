# DistortionGL (v1.0)
A JavaScript WebGL2 library template customizable for 3D or 2D projects.
<!-- > API Reference [Docs](./js/Docs/API.md) -->

## Why?
- I know libraries like ThreeJS exist but I want to understand the underlying mechanics of how the math and graphics work.
- This is just purely out of interest and fun. 
- Most code are sourced from other people and places such as stackoverflow and threejs. Those are commented within the code.

## What is this?
- This library is mainly used to utilize common game dev functions such as shader loader, scenes, math, etc.
- Modules such as Scene, GameObject, etc, are purposely empty for customizable and organized code.

### Library Contents
- 2D Camera & 3D Perspective Camera
- Keyboard & Mouse/Touch Controls
- Event handlers & GameObject class template
- Math utilities including vectors, matrices, quaternions, euler and other math utils
- Typescript now supported, including separate JavaScript jsdoc annotations
